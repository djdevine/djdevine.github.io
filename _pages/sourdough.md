Here's my recipe for sourdough. It'll most likely need tweaked for your specific starter. That is of course unless you've taken a fork of mine - lucky you!

## My Ingredients
Sourdough behaviour is super sensitive to the specific flour you use. Here's what I use:

- Strong White Bread Flour
	- [Waitrose White Bread Flour](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-white-bread-flour/006224-2744-2745) (It was the only place I could get flour earlier in 2020!)
- Rye Flour 
	- [Doves Wholemeal Rye](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/products/organic-wholemeal-rye-flour-x-1kg) (Tesco and Sainsbury's stock it)
- Salt
	- Any old table salt is fine
- Water
	- I've had better results if it has been boiled and allowed to cool

That's it!
