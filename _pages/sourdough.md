Here's my method for a rye sourdough loaf. It'll most likely need tweaked for your specific starter. That is of course unless you've taken a fork of mine - lucky you!

## Shopping List
### Consumables
Sourdough behaviour is super sensitive to the specific flour you use. Here's the consumable ingredients I use:

- Strong White Bread Flour
	- [Waitrose White Bread Flour](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-white-bread-flour/006224-2744-2745) (It was the only place I could get flour earlier in 2020!)
- Rye Flour 
	- [Doves Wholemeal Rye](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/products/organic-wholemeal-rye-flour-x-1kg) (Tesco and Sainsbury's stock it)
- Rice Flour (Optional)
	- Rice flour stops the proving loaf from sticking to the banneton because it doesn't contain gluten. Normal flour sometimes sticks.
- Semolina Flour (Optional)
	- I like to dust the loaf with semolina before putting it in the oven, it gives the crust a nice flavour.
- Salt
	- Any old table salt is fine
- Water
	- I've had better results if it has been boiled and allowed to cool. One of the disinfectants in my (excellent!) Glasgow water seems to inhibit the culture.

That's it!

### Equipment
There's a few things you'll need.

- Dough Scraper
	- Something like [this] will do. You need to be able to push the dough around on your surface to shape it well.
- Banneton
	- A lined proving basket works way better than a bowl and tea towel. Just buy one, I wish I had sooner.
- Lidded Bowl (Optional)
	- The dough needs regular attention, but between these times it has to be covered else it'll dry out. A lid is way more convenient than fiddling with cling film.
- Lame (or a very sharp knife)
	- Honestly, I don't get on with my Lame and score before baking using a regularly sharpened knife.
- Scales
	- No comment.

## Starter
It's easier to adopt an already healty starter. If you know me, just ask.

If you have to make your own, I followed James Morton's method from his book, <i>[Super Sourdough](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/super-sourdough-the-foolproof-guide-to-making-world-class-bread-at-home/9781787134652)</i> (store link supports local bookshops, but it's on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XTQ2FD) too), which incidentally is a lovely coffee table book. Be warned, it took a couple shots before I got a culture that was stable. It could be a few weeks till you have something you can start baking with if you get unlucky.
