Here's my recipe for sourdough. It'll most likely need tweaked for your specific starter. That is of course unless you've taken a fork of mine - lucky you!

## My Ingredients
Sourdough behaviour is super sensitive to the specific flour you use. Here's what I use:

- Strong White Bread Flour
	- [Waitrose White Bread Flour](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-white-bread-flour/006224-2744-2745)
- Rye Flour 
	- [Doves Wholemeal Rye](https://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/products/organic-wholemeal-rye-flour-x-1kg), Tesco and Sainsbury's stock it
- Salt
	Any old table salt is fine
- Water
	- I've had better results if it has been boiled, allow it to cool!

That's it!
